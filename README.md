# AraProc 
### Simple programs to launch FARASA-based Arabic preprocessing

AraProc provides a set of simple Java classes that allow to execute different OpenNLP [1] and FARASA [2] modules for Arabic language processing on the OpenITI corpus [3]. 

### OpenITI mARkdown removal

```
qa.qcri.iyas.MARkdown
```

A simple class with texts substitutions that aim to remove mARkdown tags from
OpenITI files. It also integrates an OpenNLP-based home-trained model for  sentence splitting.


### ArabicProcessor


```
qa.qcri.iyas.ArabicPreprocessor
```

A simple interface to launch some of the Farasa NLP modules to compute segments, clitics, lemmas, POS, and parse tress. Its input should be the sentences file generated by `qa.qcri.iyas.MARkdown` and the output will have the same path and name of th einput file plus a suffix according to the requested preprocessing. 

The usage is as follows:

```
 -c,--clitics       Compute clitics
 -f,--input <arg>   Input file
 -h,--help          This help
 -l,--lemmas        Compute lemmas
 -m,--model <arg>   Path to the farasa model; if not set:
                    resources/farasa-models/modelIteration10
 -p,--pos           Compute POS
 -s,--segments      Compute segments
 -t,--tree          Compute parse tree
```

For instance: 

```
qa.qcri.iyas.ArabicPreprocessor -f inputfile.sent  -t
```

will compute file inputfile.sent.tree with one parse tree per sentence in the input file.
